## Description

Spryker B2B Demo Shop is a collection of Spryker B2B-specific features. It suits most projects as a starting point of development and can be used to explore Spryker.

## B2B Demo Shop quick start

This section describes how to get started with the B2B Demo Shop quickly.

For detailed installation instructions, see [Installing Spryker with Docker](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/scos/dev/setup/installing-spryker-with-docker/installing-spryker-with-docker.html) or [Installing with Development Virtual Machine](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/scos/dev/developer-getting-started-guide.html#installing-spryker-with-development-virtual-machine).

### Prerequisites

For full installation prerequisites, see one of the following:
* [Installing Docker prerequisites on MacOS](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/scos/dev/setup/installing-spryker-with-docker/docker-installation-prerequisites/installing-docker-prerequisites-on-macos.html)
* [Installing Docker prerequisites on Linux](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/scos/dev/setup/installing-spryker-with-docker/docker-installation-prerequisites/installing-docker-prerequisites-on-linux.html)
* [Installing Docker prerequisites on Windows](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/scos/dev/setup/installing-spryker-with-docker/docker-installation-prerequisites/installing-docker-prerequisites-on-windows-with-wsl2.html)

### Installing the B2B Demo Shop

To set up the B2B Demo Shop and its environment, do the following:

1. Create a project folder and navigate into it:
```bash
mkdir spryker-b2b && cd spryker-b2b
```

2. Clone the B2B Demo Shop:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2b-demo-shop.git ./
```

3. Clone the Docker SDK:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:spryker/docker-sdk.git docker
```

2. Set up a desired environment:
  * [Setting up a development environment](#setting-up-a-development-environment)
  * [Setting up a production-like environment](#setting-up-a-production-like-environment)

#### Setting up a development environment

1. Bootstrap the docker setup:

```bash
docker/sdk boot deploy.dev.yml
```

2. If the command you've run in the previous step returned instructions, follow them.

3. Build and start the instance:
```bash
docker/sdk up
```

4. Switch to your branch, re-build the application with assets and demo data from the new branch:

```bash
git checkout {your_branch}
docker/sdk boot -s deploy.dev.yml
docker/sdk up --build --assets --data
```

> Depending on your requirements, you can select any combination of the following `up` command attributes. To fetch all the changes from the branch you switch to, we recommend running the command with all of them:
> - `--build` - update composer, generate transfer objects, etc.
> - `--assets` - build assets
> - `--data` - get new demo data

You've set up your Spryker B2B Demo Shop and can access your applications.


### Setting up a production-like environment

1. Bootstrap the docker setup:

```bash
docker/sdk boot -s
```

2. If the command you've run in the previous step returned instructions, follow them.

3. Build and start the instance:
```bash
docker/sdk up
```

4. Switch to your branch in one of the following ways:

  * Switch to your brunch, re-build the application with assets and demo data from the new branch:

  ```bash
  git checkout {your_branch}
  docker/sdk boot -s
  docker/sdk up --assets --data
  ```

  * Light git checkout:

  ```bash
  git checkout {your_branch}
  docker/sdk boot -s

  docker/sdk up
  ```

  > Depending on your requirements, you can select any combination of the following `up` command attributes. To fetch all the changes from the branch you switch to, we recommend running the command with all of them:
  > - `--build` - update composer, generate transfer objects, etc.
  > - `--assets` - build assets
  > - `--data` - get new demo data

5. Reload all the data:

```bash
docker/sdk clean-data && docker/sdk up && docker/sdk console q:w:s -v -s
```


You've set up your Spryker B2B Demo Shop and can access your applications.

## Troubleshooting installation of the B2B Demo Shop

This section describes the most common issues related to the installation of the B2B Demo Shop.

For a complete troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting Spryker in Docker issues](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/troubleshooting-spryker-in-docker-issues) or [Troubleshooting Spryker in Vagrant installation issues](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/troubleshooting-spryker-in-vagrant-installation-issues).

**when**

You get unexpected application behavior or errors.

**then**

1. Check the state of the directory:
```bash
git status
```

2. If there are untracked files (returned in red), and they are not necessary, remove them.

3. Restart file synchronization and rebuild the codebase:
```bash
docker/sdk trouble
docker/sdk boot -s deploy.dev.yml
docker/sdk up --build --assets
```

**when**
You do not see the expected demo data on the Storefront.

**then**

1. Open the [queue broker](http://queue.spryker.local) and wait until all the queues are empty.

2. If the queues are empty, and the issue persists, reload the demo data:
```bash
docker/sdk trouble
docker/sdk boot -s deploy.dev.yml
docker/sdk up --build --assets --data
```
